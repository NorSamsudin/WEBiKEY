            Welcome to the digital identification key of the temperate woody bamboo genus <em>Kuruna</em>. This key allows you to easily identify all the <em>Kuruna</em> species with the help
            of detailed illustrations
            of the characters used. Users can identify specimens by eliminating taxa whose characters do not match those of the specimen in hand and they can input the characters in any order.
            This key is indented to give identification facilities to ecologists, bamboo researchers, gardeners and all the bamboo interested personnel.

            The bamboos include approximately 1480 species (Bamboo Phylogeny Group, 2012; Clark et al., 2015) classified into two tribes of woody bamboos (the tropical Bambuseae and the temperate
            Arundinarieae) and one tribe of herbaceous bamboos (the Olyreae).

            <em>Kuruna</em> is one of the 12 major lineages in temperate Arundinarieae (Attigala et al., 2014) and includes six species from Sri Lanka and one species from south India. This interactive
            key will allow you to identify these seven temperate woody bamboos individually.
